# rockpaperscissor
This project aims to build a machine learning model using TensorFlow to classify images into one of three categories: rock, paper, or scissors. In the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors," each image will contain one of these objects, and the model will be trained to recognize and classify the images accordingly.

## Train Model
Here's how to train using Google Colab:
1. Copy learning.ipynb to your google drive account
2. After that, open it
3. Change runtime to T4 GPU or TPU v2-8 to speed up training process
