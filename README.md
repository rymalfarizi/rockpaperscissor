# rockpaperscissor
This project aims to build a machine learning model using TensorFlow to classify images into one of three categories: rock, paper, or scissors. In the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors," each image will contain one of these objects, and the model will be trained to recognize and classify the images accordingly.
